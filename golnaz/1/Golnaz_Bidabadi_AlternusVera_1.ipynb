    "## Identifying  the Fake News Detection Factors\n",
    "I explored some of the potential approaches for detection of fake news based on Shu, et. al (2017) paper. \"Liar, Liar Pants on Fire\" dataset, which is a dataset for experimental research on fake news detection (Wang, 2017), was used in this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering Shu, et. al (2017) paper, one of the first steps that we need to take for detection of fake news is to identify the main factors that would be considered in our computation of the fake-news-likelihood scores. Based on Shu, et. al (2017) paper, 10 of the most important factors for detection of fake news were identified:\n",
    "1. Truthfulness of major claims\n",
    "2.  Style credibility\n",
    "3. Stance values of relevant posts\n",
    "4. Credibility of relevant posts\n",
    "5. <span style=\"color:red\"> **Credibility of lexical features** </span> <=  **one of the target factor of this experiment**\n",
    "6. Credibility of syntactic features\n",
    "7. Individual-level credibility (publisher credibility or <span style=\"color:red\"> **speaker reputation** </span>) <= **Another target factor of this experiment**\t\n",
    "8. Group-level credibility of posts\n",
    "9. Temporal-level credibility of posts\n",
    "10. Network-based credibility\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment I tried to explore whether basic lexical features and speaker reputation themselves would be useful in detection of fake news and determination of level of trueness of news. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point worth mentioning is that truth and false are relative and they are very hard to be measured. So the goal was not to find whether news is just fake or not fake (true or false). That's why the Liar Liar dataset has been classified and consists of 6 different classes. **Detection of fake news is a multi-classification problem and it's not a binary classification problem**\n"

    "Speaker reputation is my second factor for detecting the fake news. For this purpose, I considered the available information provided by our dataset. After an analysis which is reflected in our documentation, I chose the features of “barely_true_counts, false_counts, half_true_counts, mostly_true_counts” to make a vector for speaker reputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses here is that, it might be possible to infer fake-news based on the number of fake news that have been assigned to the speakers previously. Clearly, this does not mean that a speaker, e.g. Barak Obama, is a person who produces the fake-news or every single news about a particular speaker is fake. However, what could be inferred from my assumption is the possibility that a fake-news is produced about a particular speaker could be higher than others. E.g. it might be the case that the number of fake-news that are produced about Obama are more than Trump.  Therefore, the history of (the number of) fake- or not-fake news about a speaker is considered in my study here. \n"

    "In this experiment, I conducted a research on detection of fake news in the Liar Liar dataset based on two factors, i.e. 'lexical features credibility' and 'speaker reputation'. The chosen factors were based on the suggestions provided by Shu et al. (2017). While none of the factors alone can be applied for detection of fake news in a satisfactory way, they can be used in the final collective model (polynomial equation) to detect the fake news. In better words, since we perceive truethfulness as a relative concept, these factors can be used to not only detect the fake news, but also to determine the level of truethfulness of any news. The weighting that could be assigned to these factors in the final polynomial equation is dependent on the other factors that has been studied."
